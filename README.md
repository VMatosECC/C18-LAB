STL List Class
The notes document demonstrates the usage of the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) 
std::list container through various operations. The app uses a custom Person struct 
to represent data and showcases how to manipulate lists, including adding, removing, 
sorting, merging, and traversing elements. The app is divided into multiple experiments, 
each focusing on specific std::list functionalities.
